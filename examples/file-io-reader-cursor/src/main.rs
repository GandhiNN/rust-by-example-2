            And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.

            The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow -
            Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
            For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,
            And he sometimes gets so little that thereâ€™s none of him at all.";
